# Automation scripts
Just a few scripts that I made for myself to automate otherwise boring and tedious tasks.
- Every script will have documentation in the source file, explaining what it does.
- Every function in the source file will be documented and explained.

## Todo
### rename-file-dir rework:
- as a command line option, choose whether you are renaming directories, or files, or both
- add replacing a substring with another string
- add replacing a char with a char
- add lowering all characters
### Misc
- ***(11.04.2023.)*** Add comments to every script, to explain exactly what it does and how it works
- ***(11.04.2023.)*** Fix push-readme to ask if you are in the right folder, and if you aren't, asks you which folder should you be in and then changes into that directory
