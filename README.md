# Automation scripts
Just a few scripts that I made for myself to automate otherwise boring and tedious tasks.
- Every script will have documentation in the source file, explaining what it does.
- Every function in the source file will be documented and explained.

## Todo
- ***(11.04.2023.)* rename-file-dir**: Add directory renaming
- ***(11.04.2023.)* rename-file-dir**: Add replacing whole strings with another string
- ***(11.04.2023.)* Add comments to every script, to explain exactly what it does and how it works**
